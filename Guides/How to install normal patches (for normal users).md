# How to install normal ledaerboard patches

First, you need to download the latest release of [DJHCPP](https://github.com/MatteoGodzilla/djhcpp/releases).
After that, you need to download the patch file by clicking on [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crafty-The-Fox/djh-leaderboard-patches/main/Patches/song%20patch.xml), then right click the page and click save as. Save the file then open up DJHCPP, go to tools then "Apply Patch" as seen below. ![Apply patch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Crafty-The-Fox/djh-leaderboard-patches/main/Guides/images/patch%20install.JPG)

After that, you need to go to your downloads folder or whereever you saved the file and select it. It should look something like this after selecting it.

Then, click "Ok". If you see an error where you dont have a custom installed, you can install the custom and re apply the patch, or just ignore it.

After that, boot up your game and enjoy!
